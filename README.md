## 2022 Notes

File was unchanged keeping old styles and `var` declarations.
Just deleted unused file and keeping name convention of plugins author (with capital "T" in "jqTree").
Second part of test task (tweet.html) is inaccessible as API went down (http://api.massrelevance.com/reccosxof/matchtrax_hashclash_featured_tweets.json).
